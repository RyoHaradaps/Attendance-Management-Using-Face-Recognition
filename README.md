# üë®‚Äçüíº Attendance Management Using Face Recognition

This project is a simple and efficient attendance system that uses real-time face recognition to mark attendance. Designed using Python with a Tkinter-based GUI, OpenCV for facial detection, and MySQL for backend storage. Built during my internship at Indian Oil Corporation, Gujarat Refinery.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- To install `pillow`:
    ```bash
    pip install pillow
    ```
- To install `mysql-connector-python`:
    ```bash
    pip install mysql-connector-python
    ```
- To install `opencv-python`:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
- To install `reportlab`:
    ```bash
    pip install reportlab
    ```

### 2. Set Up the Database
- Open **MySQL** or **MySQL Workbench**
- Create a new database (e.g., `attendance_system`)
- Inside it, create the necessary tables like `employee`, `attendance`, `loginRegister`, etc.
- Make sure your table and field names match those used in the code

### 3. Update Paths and Database Config

- üìå **NOTE:** 
    - Don‚Äôt forget to change the **image paths** in the code to match your local system (especially for saving/loading face images)
    - Make sure to delete `classfr.xml` before training the data images(file will generate/rewrite automatically on every train execution)
    Otherwise, things won‚Äôt work as expected!
  
- üõ†Ô∏è Also make sure to update your **database settings** in the file:
  - Change the **database name**
  - Update your **MySQL username and password**
  - Ensure the **host** (usually `localhost`) is correct
  - Double-check that the **table names** and **field names** used in your MySQL database match what's in the code

### 4. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```

## ü§î What to Watch Out on Work

- Ensure your webcam is working

- Keep lighting consistent for better accuracy

- Use grayscale, resized face images (200x200 px recommended)

- Proxy attendance? Not anymore! üòâ

## üìå Future Improvements

- Can Exact the code into `.exe` file format

- Add CNN-based deep learning for higher recognition accuracy

- Mobile version for remote attendance logging

- Integration with gate pass or HR systems

- Better UI styling with modern frameworks (e.g., PyQt or web-based frontend)
